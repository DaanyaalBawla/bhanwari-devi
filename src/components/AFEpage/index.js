            India‚Äôs tech industry employs 10 million people; however, women only
            make up 34% of the workforce. Women represent 40% of entry-level
            tech jobs & the representation gets lower as they move up with 30%
            at the mid-level positions and as low as 20% in senior roles.

          <p>
            To reduce the gender gap in technology and equip them with CS
            readiness skills, we work with young women from underserved
            communities.
